# Less Commute

!["Less commute hero image"](img/hero.gif?raw=true)

## Introduction

Less Commute is a hobby project aimed to reduce commute time for people living in Singapore. Currently, you can use Less Commute to compare the fare and duration of your commute between your work and places. You can use this data to understand how much money and time you are using every month for commuting, and consider relocation.

## :wrench: Technology used and Setup

Less Commute is built using React+Redux and Typescript and bootstrapped using [Typescript-React-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter). To run Less Commute locally, you need node.js and npm installed.

```
npm install
npm run start
```

You will also needs to retrive google maps javascript api key and replace the key in `public\index.html`. You can read up on how to get an API key [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)
